                <h2>Make a map using Carto</h2>
                <p>This week we talked about using <a href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a> to make online maps.</p>
                <p>Create a map in Carto using at least two layers of data. This could be a map from a previous assignment that you made in QGIS that you would like to try to put online. Or it could be a new map using data sources that are relevant to your project or other research.</p>
                <p>I'm looking to see that you are able to upload data to Carto, style it, and publish the map. If you have time I would like to see you try using widgets and popups.</p>
                <p>Share the map publicly and submit the link to your map. As usual, please include a short description of what you did, any issues you might have come upon, how you might have done things differently given the time/techniques to do so.</p>
