                <h2>1a: Installing QGIS</h2>
                <p>Install <a href="https://qgis.org/"><span>QGIS</span></a> on your computer. If you have an older version I highly recommend upgrading to 3.14 now. QGIS is generally straightforward to get working on both Windows and OS X:</p>
                <p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visit the <a class="external" href="https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>QGIS download page</span></a>.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Download for Windows</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Select the appropriate package (32 bit or 64 bit) and download it. If you're not sure, go with <strong>QGIS Standalone Installer Version 3.14 (64 bit)</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Once the package has downloaded, run it.</li>
                    <li>Open QGIS to confirm that it works. If you do not see a <strong>Vector</strong> menu or the available plugins list (<strong>Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins</strong>) is empty, there may have been an issue installing QGIS.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>OS X</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visit the <a class="external" href="https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>QGIS download page</span></a>.</li>
                    <li>Download the installer package titled <strong>QGIS macOS Installer Version 3.14</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Install QGIS using the installer package.</li>
                    <li>Open QGIS to confirm that it works. If you do not see a <strong>Vector</strong> menu or the available plugins list (<strong>Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins</strong>) is empty, there may have been an issue installing QGIS.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>1b: Drawing Your Mental Map</h2>
                <p>Each of us carries a spatial representation of our immediate and general environments in our mind. Usually these spatial representations have similar elements: edges, nodes, paths, districts &amp; landmarks (eg Kevin Lynch, <em>Image of the City</em>). Using <strong>analog</strong> tools such as paper, pens, pencils, really whatever you have at hand or choose, put your "mental image" or mental map to paper for New York City.</p>
                <p>The focus lies on the content and not the beauty of the mental map, and there is no right or wrong. The key is that the mental map must not be copied from a map or image but rather drawn from memory.</p>
                <p>It may be helpful to break the process into three phases. First is the skeleton phase, it contains most of the important information, objects, direction, names and paths. The second phase puts the flesh on by linking between memories with information and description. This will often trigger some more memories and makes the map rich and representative. The third and last phase can focus upon the larger aesthetic and themes of the map but no more important information is added, but rather the map is adjusted and critiqued.</p>
                <p>Bring finished maps to class, and we will compare/critique the maps. This exercise will further unearth how we think about New York City, how we navigate it and how our experience may lead to ideas to contribute to later work in this course.</p>

                <h2>1c: Respond to mental maps</h2>
                <p>Now that everyone has drawn and shared their mental maps of New York City, look at your <a title="Assignment 1a: Drawing your mental map" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1523104/assignments/8216302" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.newschool.edu/api/v1/courses/1523104/assignments/8216302" data-api-returntype="Assignment">classmates' submissions in the discussion thread</a>. Pick <strong>at least one</strong> to respond to and write a response after clicking the <strong>Respond</strong> button for that post. Please ensure that you are responding directly to a post rather than creating a new post as this will keep the conversation organized.</p>
                <p>You are free to say anything in your response as long as you are respectful and constructive. Please include the following at a minimum:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A response to the <strong>design</strong> (cartography) of the map. Are you noticing choices that the mapmaker made in terms of colors, line patterns, or other decisions that impact how the map looks?</li>
                    <li>A response to the <strong>content</strong> of the map. What has the mapmaker chosen to include or exclude? What is the map centering?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is no submission for this assignment, but your participation in <a title="Assignment 1a: Drawing your mental map" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1523104/assignments/8216302" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.newschool.edu/api/v1/courses/1523104/assignments/8216302" data-api-returntype="Assignment">the discussion thread</a> will be noted here.</p>

                <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
                <p>Take a picture of your map and upload it in Canvas as a discussion response. Your classmates will be able to see your mental map, and you will be asked to look at your classmates' mental maps. Please also include a few sentences about your map. What you say here is up to you, but you might talk about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>your thought process while making it,</li>
                    <li>what was difficult or easy about it, or</li>
                    <li>what (if anything) you learned about your mental model of the city in making this map.</li>
                </ul>
