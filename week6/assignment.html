                <p>When you <em>join</em> two or more datasets, you combine them feature-by-feature, and this often gives attributes to a feature that it would not have otherwise had.</p>
                <p><strong>Attribute joins</strong> add attributes to features based on a <strong>unique identifier</strong>. Often you will have a spatial dataset (such as a shapefile) and a CSV file with extra data that you would like to map. As long as both the spatial data and the CSV have a common unique identifier (sometimes this is a name, but it could be a unique number or an address) you can join them in QGIS and add the data from the CSV to the spatial data.</p>
                <p>Use attribute joins and US Census data to map either <strong>renter occupancy</strong> or <strong>median household income</strong> by census tract in the area within NYC you have been focusing on over the past few assignments.</p>
                <p>Download census data using <a href="https://data.census.gov/">data.census.gov</a>, join with the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.2018.html">census tracts</a>, and make a choropleth map with some of the joined data. Choose which data to get:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>renter vs owner occupancy
                        <ol>
                            <li>Search for <strong>housing tenure</strong></li>
                            <li>Click the first result <strong>(Selected Housing Characteristics</strong>)</li>
                            <li>Change the <strong>product</strong> to 2019 ACS 5-year</li>
                            <li>Click <strong>Customize Table</strong></li>
                            <li>Under <strong>Geographies</strong> select <strong>Tract</strong><strong> &gt; New York &gt; All Census Tracts in New York</strong></li>
                            <li>Click <strong>Download Table</strong></li>
                            <li>As discussed in class, you will likely want to edit the CSV that you download.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>household income
                        <ol>
                            <li>Search for <strong>household income</strong></li>
                            <li>Click the first result (<strong>Income in the past 12 months...</strong>)</li>
                            <li>Change the <strong>product</strong> to 2019 ACS 5-year</li>
                            <li>Click <strong>Customize Table</strong></li>
                            <li>Under <strong>Geographies</strong> select <strong>Tract</strong><strong> &gt; New York &gt; All Census Tracts in New York</strong></li>
                            <li>Click <strong>Download Table</strong></li>
                            <li>As discussed in class, you will likely want to edit the CSV that you download.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
