                <h2>Answering Research Questions</h2>
                <p>Today we're going to spend most of class working on one research question that pulls together many of the QGIS tools we've covered in class. You will complete this project for homework. For this exercise, we will download census data and shapefiles to answer a research question about access to home ownership across the country inspired by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/california-housing.html" target="_blank">this</a> article about the decline in access to home ownership in San Diego from the New York Times.</p>

                <p><em>When Ms. Coats moved into the Baxter Street house, a family needed right around the area’s median income to afford the $82 monthly mortgage payment — the definition of middle class. Today a typical Clairemont home costs $850,000, up 30 percent from 2019. A family would need to make about double San Diego’s median income to afford one.</em></p>
                <p>We will test whether this is true in other cities using data from the 5-year ACS.  For one city in the United States, create a map of the areas where the “median” family can afford to purchase a home.  We will determine which census tracts a family making the city’s median household income can afford to purchase a home in.</p>
                <p>First, pick a city in the US. If you don’t have a specific city in mind, consider Austin TX, Denver CO, Chicago IL, Minneapolis WI, Seattle WA, Portland OR, San Jose CA, Columbus OH, Birmingham AL, Raleigh NC, Charlotte NC.</p>
                <p>We will download median household income (MHI) for every city and the median property value (MPV) for every census tract in the state of your choosing.  Using geoprocessing tools that we have studied, we’ll create a census tracts shapefile with indicators of whether the median household can afford a home there.  And we will create a map to show it.</p>

                    </ul> 
                    <li>Explore different ways to style the layer to answer the research question.  I do thisby right-clicking the census tracts layer to duplicate the layer and style it in different ways to compare.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a graduated style of aff_ratio with at least 5 bins, use the histogram feature to view your data and and select appropriate bins</li>
                        <li>Create a graduated style with aff_diff with at least 5 bins, use the histogram feature to view your data and and select appropriate bins</li>
                        <li>Create 2-class graduated style to show areas where the median family can afford to buy, and where they cannot</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <li>Create two maps of your city using Print Layout to represent what areas are affordable to the median household.  Add other layers for context like streets, parks or other features.  Explore the basemaps using QuickMapServices to see if you can use a basemap instead of downloading data.  Hint, most of the basemaps have multiple versions with and without labels.</li>
                    <li>OPTIONAL: Add a heat map of affordable housing for your city using the LIHTC data from the in-class exercise for context about the spatial relationship between affordable housing and middle class access to home ownership.</li>
                    <li>Upload your two maps to the Discussion page and answer the following questions:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is home ownership available to the median household in your city?</li>
                        <li>Do you notice any spatial patterns in access to home ownership?</li>
                        <li>What next steps would you take to continue to explore this question?</li>
                    </ul>
