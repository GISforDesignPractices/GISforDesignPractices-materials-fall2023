                <p>Now that you have some experience in QGIS, let's expand on that by making a few common types of maps: qualitative and quantitative maps.</p>

                <h2>Resources</h2>
                <p>For choosing your data classification scheme for the second part, please refer to thi week's readings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.axismaps.com/guide/data-classification">The Basics of Data Classification</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2011/10/telling-truth.html">Telling the Truth</a>, a quick look at which classification schemes work better for example distributions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Additional resources on the topic of data classification:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/671">The concepts page for a Penn State class on Cartography and Visualization.</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://krygier.owu.edu/krygier_html/geog_353/geog_353_lo/geog_353_lo07.html">Krygier's outline for his Cartography and Visualization class</a>. You can skip the sections dealing with ArcGIS and ArcView--the concepts are the important part. The classification schemes are listed under "Ideographic schemes" (search for it, it's around half of the way down the page).</li>

                <h2>Part 1: A Quantitative Thematic Map</h2>
                <p>As you did in <a title="Assignment 2b: A Large Scale Map" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1523104/assignments/8329547" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.newschool.edu/api/v1/courses/1523104/assignments/8329547" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Assignment 2b</a>, focus on a small area within New York (or somewhere else where you can find similar data). Select a point data source such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9">311 requests</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95">car crashes</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Filter the data down to a reasonable amount (for example, 311 requests of a particular type over the past month). Count the points in <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2010-Census-Tracts/fxpq-c8ku">census tracts</a> using <strong>count points in polygons</strong> and create a <strong>graduated</strong> style of the result.</p>
                <p>Consider the colors you're using and the method you're using to classify the data. If there are outliers, consider the following: Do those outliers make sense to you? Are they a quirk of the data?</p>
                <p>Create a PDF of your map using a print layout. Include map elements as is useful (title, legend, and data source listing are a good start).</p>
                <p>Share your work in Canvas including a short summary of your work. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>

                <h2>Part 2: Carto</h2>
                <p>Next week we will start looking at Carto. The New School has an agreement with the company that lets us give more space to students as needed. To take advantage of this, please create a login with your New School email address using <a class="external" href="https://thenewschool.carto.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> if you haven't already.</p>
                <p>If you already have a Carto account with your New School email address and the above link does not work as a result, please login to your existing account and change the email address associated with it, then try signing up again.</p>
                <p>You don't have to do anything else with Carto for now, we will start talking about it next week.</p>
